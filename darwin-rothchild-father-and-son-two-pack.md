3AA Exclusive Edition

From the official ThreeA promotional materials:

"I look upon 003 as a father does his child.
I gave 003 the gift to judge, it finds most wanting.
I would not be surprised to wake to find both knives inserted in me.
I of course expect no less, if indeed he had found me wanting.
I am indeed a proud father."
