This character is not a toy... yet! 

Golden Zombot was mentioned in a <a href="https://www.worldofthreea.com/threea-production-blog/qa41" target="_blank">blog update of the Sunday Q and A by Ashley Wood.</a>

<p class="blockquote">Q: Do characters like the Golden Zombot, Lemon Guard, or the Downside among others exist in physical form at least like in a drawing or sketch? Or are they just mental amoebas still trying to take shape?

A: Golden Zombot is real, already! Lemon guard too, the Downside is a buddy of the Golden Dolphin, maybe the most fucked up character in the entire Adventure Kartel world!</p>
