"My Love is On Parade"

"THEN YOU TURN AWAY 30 TIMES - Oliver Apple Hair tossed the dead bird through the front door, the front door of a house where Ursula Lilith Le Fey had made herself a home. A Simple trick, if the dead bird begins to sing it means she is home and it would be unwise to enter!

It didn't sing. Oliver skipped through the door to find her prize, a transparent Heel that held a ghost. A ghost of Oliver Apple Hair!" - TP Louise and Ashley Wood, 3A Adventure 001, April 2014 (page 19)
