backstory:
---
"Disdained, outcast, ridiculed, mocked, called nancy boys and generally not invited to parties... the outcast of an already outcast group, this was pretty much what was described of TKs who were created with the inferior 'Heavy' genetic code. The same also applied with the Heavy Lopers.

Since they lacked the skills of wielding traditional TK weapons, they opted for the usage of big guns instead.
