backstory:
---
From the Official 3A promotional materials: 
"And we asked, why is your hand red?

-- From hidden eyes he answered... --

It is stained with blood, of my friends and enemies."

This version of Tommy features a hooded jacket, black t-shirt with red star image on the chest, grey weathered pants and red sneakers. His right hand is red (of course) and he comes with a cool messenger-style shoulder bag.
