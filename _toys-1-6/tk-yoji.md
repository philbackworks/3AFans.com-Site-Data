backstory:
---
Blind Box single, but there was also a 3-pack featuring TK Kenshiro, TK Hideo, and TK Yoji.

"Designers of high-fashion urban streetwear and the leaders of global warfare saw opportunity with the TK to commercialize their products by outfitting these agile and fearless warriors in their latest and greatest. In turn, making the TK pop culture icons throughout the universe. Youthful looks combined with enemy bloodshed proved to be a financial winner for all concerned." - Recounted in the convention booklet (limited, free for attendees in Singapore), "Ultra Tomorrow" that celebrates TK releases from 2008 - 2019, Ashley Wood
