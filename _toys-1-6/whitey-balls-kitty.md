 Kitty is one of the main protaganists of the Popbot series. He was once the lead singer and frontman of the punk band, "2215 Funlicker". Much of the Popbot story revolves around his bad decisions, debauchery, sexual misconduct and foul-mouthed drama he participates in throughout the music industry. His badass robotic pal, Popbot, follows along as a protector and friend.
