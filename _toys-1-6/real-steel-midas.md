From <a href="https://www.goodsmile.info/en/product/3662/REAL+STEEL+MIDAS.html" target="_blank">Goodsmile.com</a>:

"From the movie "Real Steel", Midas has a number of highlights, such as his shining golden body and red Mohawk styled hair. His body is also covered in scratches and dents from all his previous fights and all his joints are filled with cylinders and wires for a truly realistic appearance! His eyes are also loaded with fiber optic lights."
