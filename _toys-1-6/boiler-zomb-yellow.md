June 27, 2009 - From toysrevil.blogspot.com - "FYI - The <a href="/toys-1-6/zombot.html">ZOMBOT</a> is a 'lottery chase' - whereby anybody who had bought a regular Boiler Zomb will be eligible for. Ashley Wood says - 'if you get a zombot via lottery it's a choice to purchase on top of standard, or swap etc ... if you get via blind box, you can indeed get the zombie that was originally wanted or you email 3A and say no way to chase or rares in advance.'

A total of 5 Zomb Bots will be offeyellow via lottery, while the rest (unspecified quantity) will be randomly inserted into boxes of standard Zombs.
