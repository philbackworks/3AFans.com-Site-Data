backstory:
---
<p>Lasstranaut, aka Tracey S (or is it Catherine Jones?), found and freed the Nabler from the prison of his own design. "Lasstranaut - mysterious pilot of the pant-less space ways, and great egg frier."</p>
<cite>7174 Adventure Prelude by Ashley Wood and T.P. Louise, 9/2017</cite>

"The Criminal Star supplies the power need by Lasstranaut to do her work, the star is small in size but FUCKING HUGE IN THE POWER STAKES! So yea, I assume he will pop along for the ride!"

"...you know, the figure exudes the quality I wanted, it's a fun figure. Re: skin, well I don't know its name, I'll deem it stretchy stuff from today! And remember, this is it, no more Lass releases, she doesn't come in other colors, or variations â€” there is only one Lass! Mark my words, we will be working hard up till the last moment before production to make Lass the best!"
