<p class="blockquote">[June 27, 2013] Ashley illustrated for The Swank Autumn/Winter campaign. For those of you who are interested in the work produced, this series of artwork will be featured on buses and trams in China and Hong Kong and will be also reproduced in an extensive advertising campaign that will appear in such magazines as Elle, Cosmopolitan and Harper's Baazar.</p>

<p>The Swank stores will also be carrying the campaign in-store naturally, along with a seriously limited line of the female figures who appear in the campaign "Swank Girls" (and Guys!) and "Autumn apples". These figures will be carried from August 2013 through to December 2013.</p>
