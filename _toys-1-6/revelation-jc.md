backstory:

This has not been released as a toy... yet! Ashley Wood mentioned this figure would be the next JC release, way back in the <a href="https://www.worldofthreea.com/threea-production-blog/qa37" target="_blank">ThreeA Blog Q & A #37</a>. When speaking with Ash at San Diego Comic Con, he mentioned on two separate occasions that there would be another JC release and that the next one would include a large cross that JC could carry on his back. - Phil

Ash also mentioned, "...Need an ESCAPE FROM NEW ALEXANDRIA JC too."
