"Disdained, outcast, ridiculed, mocked...

Called Nancy Boys and generally not invited to parties, Heavy TK's are the outcasts of an already outcast group.

Foregoing traditional weapons for big guns, they walk alone masters of the boom."  - Ashley Wood, promotional material and backstory. Ultra Tomorrow Kings TK convention booklet, 2019
