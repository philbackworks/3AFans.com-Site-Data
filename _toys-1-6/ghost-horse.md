The Ghost Horse, "Ghost" was offered as part of the Super Set. It's made of resin and has fabric wraps around each leg, the neck, head and tail. Comes with a saddle and holsters.

From the official ThreeA promotional material:

"His family killed by a gang of deranged robots, his eyesight taken as payment for someone else's debt. He now wears the rag reputedly used to mop the bloody brow of the assassinated JFK, the turgid rag now giving a clarity of vision, a clarity of justice and revenge to the <a href="/toys-1-6/blind-cowboy.html">Blind Cowboy</a>. His is only friend, a horse named Ghost!"
