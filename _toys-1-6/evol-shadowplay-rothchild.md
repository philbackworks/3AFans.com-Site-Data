World War Robot: EVOL ... This blacked-out version of Rothchild features a wicked cybernetic arm, eyepatch and shoulder holster. He's wearing a clean white shirt with tie and black pants.

On the 'Shadow' and 'Soy' versions of characters:
"They are just what they are, they don't consider good or bad as a disposition, just following their natural agenda, they do seem to have a distaste for robots though!"
