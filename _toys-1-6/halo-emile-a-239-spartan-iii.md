 From the promotional materials: 
 
 "After the destruction of Eridanus II, a young and orphaned Emile was grafted into the SPARTAN-III program, eventually engaging both rebels and the Covenant across human-occupied space. Later in his career he joined Noble Team, an elite strike force within the Special Wafare division. Though a bit unruly and oftentimes overzealous, Emile was fiercely dedicated to the UNSC, particularly to his Noble Team comrades."

"Warrant Officer Emile-A239 was a SPARTAN-III commando of the UNSC Naval Special Warfare Command, attached to Special Warfare Group Three of the UNSC Army. He fought as part of NOBLE Team with the call sign Noble Four, during the Fall of Reach in summer 2552."
