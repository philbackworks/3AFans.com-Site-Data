THE FIRST FALLEN

Yellow helmet, red shirt short sleeve shirt with yellow long sleeve extensions roughly sewn on. Single hose with dirty red cloth shroud.

It's been said that when Kuan ti Plume was released at the Beijing Gathering in 2010, that people were camping overnight, outside, waiting to get in and buy this figure.
