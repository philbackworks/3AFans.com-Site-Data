Q: Can you please give us some additional information on Ghost Nage, is he a Loper?

A: Ghost Nage isnt a loper, its by product of the Underverse, he kinda looks and becomes a ghost, existing between the present universe and the Underverse. the Mortis have finally moved on from grey TK looking bots, to more devious simulacrum now.
