Q: What is the story of the weathered DW [<a href="/wwr/factions/daywatch.html">Daywatch</a>] and NW [<a href="/wwr/factions/nightwatch.html">Nightwatch</a>] Harolds? Why hasn't the skull on NW Harold emerged like the last weathered NW (<a href="/toys-1-6/heavy-bramble-nom-nightwatch.html">Heavy Bram</a> and Square MK2s)?
A: Times change as so do factions ID, as the DW AND NW have now been revealed as NOM, certain imagery has changed and will change. DW, NW get a make over this year, they are the new freedom fighters for mankind!
