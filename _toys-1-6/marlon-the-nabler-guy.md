From the official ThreeA promotional materials: 

"Like a burnished end seethed Marlon"

"An underground army of the ultimate non conformists, no regard for right or wrong, or what the current thinking believes prudent! The Nabler Guy strike out on their own verve. A path best left alone unless you intend to join their family!

Features an orange body, weathered orange jumpsuit, orange sneakers and a baseball bat... and a 1/6 d*ck.
