 <p class="blockquote">Q: Since you mentioned that the R/C Girl TKYO is going to use the Queeny sculpt, will she be getting a staff-like weapon; like a mic with stand or some such?
A: Not the same sculpt, same stock, as in genetic, Queeny is what would be considered an older TQ, not many TQ's make the age of Queeny, GIRL R/C is much younger, had her age! All new sculpt etc, she brandishes a Mic and quick witted verses as her weapon of choice. Or a snub nose blaster if that don't work!
