From the Official ThreeA promotional materials:
"Adventure Kartel grows a pair! - 1/6th, 14.5" tall, fully articulated body, like the first Ankou Shadow Security, only BIGGER AND BETTER.. really, We have no images, but we promise a cool figure... we love you... really! Thats why we use images of Little Shadow to sell the Ankou EX!

BUT REMEMBER, THIS SET DOES NOT COME WITH LIL SHADOW OR A SKULL < THEY ARE LURES!!!!" - *Source: Bambaland.com sale page*

This guy was offered up for pre-sale with a promo poster image featuring a black-n-white ink sketch of Little Shadow sitting atop a huge skull with a googly eye. No product photography was available at the time of the pre-sale. Small print on the poster: "We have no shots of the Shadow EX Ankou EX, but look, Little Shadow has long legs... 3A runs off"

Was offered as a 24-hour sale.
