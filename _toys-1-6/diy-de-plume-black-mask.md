AKA "The Last de Plume"

This rare figure was not for sale as a release, but instead was awarded as a contest prize or gift.

"Ash soon gave fans the chance to create their own de Plume. The DIY de Plume, described as a weirdo clean freak munitions expert and a base for creative types in another world. A new platform for the brave. A contest held on the Legion Outpost encouraging members to compete in creating and designing new garb and backstories for the chance at owning the penultimate DIY de Plume." - TP Louise and Ashley Wood, 3A Adventure 001, April 2014 (page 36-37)
