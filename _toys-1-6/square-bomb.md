WWR SQUARE 1.5a 1/6th
"BOOM! the Square 1.5a ( also known as the Square Bomb) was only tested for 3 days at Square Park ENZO, on the third day all the Square 1.5a got together and went KABOOM, they were, after all, little shits with bombs on their backs. ENZO park was no more and with the lead B-SQUARE Engineers killed in the explosions and all prototypes destroyed the test program ended... OR WAS IT!" - ThreeA
