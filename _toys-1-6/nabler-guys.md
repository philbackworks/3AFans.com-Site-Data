From the official ThreeA promotional materials: 

"The eroticization of the gaze is homologous with the discourse of power/knowledge"
"The (re)formation of desire clarifies the position of the fantasy of the gendered body."
"We never forget, we never forgive, we will always be waiting! Nabler Guys Only from 3A!"

"The natural offspring of human/nabler relations: The Nabler Guy!"

Listed on bambaland.com as:

"R RATED SMILING NABLER GUY RANDOM BLIND BOX THINGY" - There appears to be multiple color variations available as part of this release, not including the 'last nabler guy' (orange body, black jeans, black jacket and t-shirt with white print) offered in the Halloween 2 Pack with Liz. There was also a 3AA Exclusive Nabler Guy - "Like a burnished end seethed Marlon" - Popbot Nabler (orange body, weathered orange jumpsuit, orange sneakers and a baseball bat).
