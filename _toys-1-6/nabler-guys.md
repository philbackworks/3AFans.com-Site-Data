From the official ThreeA promotional materials: 

"The eroticization of the gaze is homologous with the discourse of power/knowledge"
"The (re)formation of desire clarifies the position of the fantasy of the gendered body."
"We never forget, we never forgive, we will always be waiting! Nabler Guys Only from 3A!"

"The natural offspring of human/nabler relations: The Nabler Guy!"
