"They fight in 4D {x}=(p,q,r,s) Extract from Bernard Sumner's book 'The Up Brain'

The whine and scream of Mortis Devil bots in the distance rouse Yama and Naga from their sleep, with machine like precision they prepare for battle, not a word or look is exchanged between." - Ultra Tomorrow TK convention booklet - 2019

"With a slight acknowledgement of my presence, they leave our temporary dwelling for battle. I never saw them again, my time with them remarkably serene and enlightening considering my guests' disposition of being bred for war, their minds able to calcite such complex equation in per-time giving them access to special abilities outside the norm. With autism once considered a debilitating state of mind it could now look to be a high evolutionary path?

From my observations both Yama and Naga always set out to find the most elegant and simple path to all action, whether crossing a room or bringing down a one hundred foot tall warbot with a single stroke of a blade, nothing is wasted from breath to thought. What I find most interesting is their behavioral differences.  

TK's have always seemed to share a similar disposition and lack of defining individual character, whereas Yama and Naga are quite different, Naga is more, for a lack of a better word congenial, where Yama seems aggressive and brooding.

I ask, are they the next step in the evolution of TK, a warrior bred for fighting and nothing more, or just an anomaly?

What happens when they want more? Can we be seen as anything other than inferior to them?

Mortis air bursts get louder, we are moving out Yama and Naga move in.

How long the night seems to one kept awake by pain." - Ashley Wood, promotional material and backstory. Ultra Tomorrow Kings TK convention booklet, 2019
