 "Every collective has an enforcer street gang, ice hockey, government etc. Marquis is the NOM's go-to guy to lay the strap down. <strong>He has taught the best, he has killed the best.</strong>"
<cite>- Ashley Wood, <a href="http://worldof3alegion.forumotion.com/t287-qa-sessions-with-ashley-wood" target="_blank">ThreeA blog Q and A (#19)</a></cite>

 "The double tank denote a different make up of veil parting gases, they have many varied mixes depending on their path! Marquis are strong and talented bunch, but as evolution has shown there is always bigger and stronger, on both sides of the path. The NOM story is great fun for me, I will be introducing some new players soon, Fallen and the Callen!" - Ashley Wood, <a href="https://www.worldofthreea.com/threea-production-blog/qa39" target="_blank">Q and A #39</a>
