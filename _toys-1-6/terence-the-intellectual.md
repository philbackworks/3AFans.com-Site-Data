"Shadow Tommy + Terrance the Intellectuals Choice Zomb

So why is he hanging with Tommy?

Why is Tommy all Inky Emo?

And how do you steal your own soul back, when you know no on ehas called? Ever.

Night of the Inky Black Things

And the band played Ladri Della Notte, and somewhere a tear stained an old faded photograph of a forgotten father." - ThreeA
