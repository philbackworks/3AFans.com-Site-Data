ABOUT BLACK ZOMBOT: 
"The black zombot is a gift from the Shadow family to Tommy, after his father goes missing etc. Tommy hates it, and never lets it ride shotgun."

On the 'Shadow' and 'Soy' versions of characters:
"They are just what they are, they don't consider good or bad as a disposition, just following their natural agenda, they do seem to have a distaste for robots though!"
