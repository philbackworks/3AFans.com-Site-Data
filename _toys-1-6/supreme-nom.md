"...in the NOM world all women are supreme, as they represent a good balance, to become the supreme is based on genetic lineage and training, the first NOM mother was known to have existed in the 19th century, their path and mission is long and steeped in history!"

"Surpreme NOM want them (the <a href="/toys-1-6/jung-de-plume.html">Fallen de Plume</a>) all dead, flayed like eels in front of her! <a href="/toys-1-6/noir-de-plume.html">Noir</a> isnt fallen, <a href="/world-war-robot-story/#theNom">FALLEN</a> is a very different way of thinking from the NOM, Noir is more a independent NOM member, still follows the Supreme NOM, but in his own way."
