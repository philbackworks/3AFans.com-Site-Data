"...Sun and <a href="/toys-1-6/ronin-tk-moon.html">Moon</a> run together, Moon operates after sundown, Sun during the day, they share their spoils."
<cite>- Ashley Wood, <a href="http://worldof3alegion.forumotion.com/t287-qa-sessions-with-ashley-wood" target="_blank">ThreeA blog Q and A (#9)</a></cite>

"Q: Will one or both sides of TKLUB Ronin Oya Suns collar be able to open with velcro, so he can be displayed with head visible and collar flat around neck? Can you please reveal / hint more about Ronin Oya Sun?

A: You can remove the whole collar thingy, or position as you like, its rather nifty, and with some thought many combos can be attained, ill get more images out showing this before the sale. Sun and Moon represent a shift or rather flaw in the TK genetic line, becoming more individual as they grow older, hence the need for G2 TK, coming after Sun!"
