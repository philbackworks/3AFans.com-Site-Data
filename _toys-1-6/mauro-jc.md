backstory:
---
A "Limited Chase Variant" - Pale As F*ck JC features the "New Pissed Off Head Sculpt", has fabric bandages, fake leather boots and comes with a "newly sculpted zombie head". This figure was a C.O.O. release... but we need more info on what that actually stands for.

"One thousand heads I shall deliver on this night, the RED NIGHT!"
