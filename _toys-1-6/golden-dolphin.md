Golden Dolpin is <a href="/toys-1-6/peppermint-grove/">Peppermint Grove's</a> brother.

"Q: What type of fighting style does Golden Dolphin use to keep his enemies at bay?

A: GD beats the fuck outta them with his robot fist, kicks them in the balls with his boots, and like to poke them on the eye with the snout of his Dolhin hat! If that fails he berates them with the doctrine of the GD!"
