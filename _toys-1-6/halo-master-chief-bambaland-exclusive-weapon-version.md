The weapons included are the ARC-920 railgun, MA5D assault rifle, and M11 combat knife. When bought from the Bambaland store, an exclusive Z-250 lightrifle is included."

 "Master Chief Petty Officer John-117 is a Spartan-II supersoldier of the UNSC Navy's Special Weapons division. He served as one of the most important figures of the Human-Covenant War. After over thirty years of active duty, he is one of the most decorated war veterans of the United Nations Space Command. By August 30, 2552, John's career service vitae recorded two hundred and seven ground engagements against the Covenant in which he had participated. By August of 2558, he had completed two hundred and nine military operations."
