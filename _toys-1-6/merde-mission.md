Merde Mission is the father of Bleak Mission and grandfather of Tommy Mission.

From the official promotional material from ThreeA:

"Adventure Kartel - Not For Starlings"

"If I was French, I would be called Shit. I'm OK with that. - Merde Mission"

"Merde was a Major, classic adventure soldier, fighting in obscure skirmishes in the Himalayas against Nazi Yeti, to hunting war ghost criminals throughout Africa etc etc!" - Ashley Wood, <a href="https://www.worldofthreea.com/threea-production-blog/qa40" target="_blank">Q and A #40</a> 

When asked who would win in a fight, Merde, Bleak or Tommy, Ash replied, "Merde would clean 'em all up, ruthless cunt of man, I mean Stallone, Schwartz, Die Hard era Bruce Willis - any fucker actually! C'mon his name is French for "shit", you have to be tough to wear that mantle!"

"... Merde has always had a penchant for German Shepherd, he see's all other dogs as weak, unlike his now departed GS ROMMEL! Do we need a Rommel German shepherd, I would like one, actually we are working on a 1:1 Custard in Hoody and battle fatigues, I think a Shepherd would work well in 1:1. 3A pets, better that the real thing, why, they look cooler and dont piss or shit on your carpet! And if you want to buy a good quality living dog, our will be cheaper as well. 3A KENNELS!"
