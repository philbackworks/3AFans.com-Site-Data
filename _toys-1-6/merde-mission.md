There were 2 releases of this awesome 4-pack: the first at the Japan Venture 3A event, along with a Bambaland.com version.

From the official promotional material from ThreeA:

"Adventure Kartel - Not For Starlings"

"If I was French, I would be called Shit. I'm OK with that. - Merde Mission"

"Merde was a Major, classic adventure soldier, fighting in obscure skirmishes in the Himalayas against Nazi Yeti, to hunting war ghost criminals throughout Africa etc etc!" - Ashley Wood, <a href="https://www.worldofthreea.com/threea-production-blog/qa40" target="_blank">Q and A #40</a>
