"DOES IT STILL SHINE GOLD IN THE DARK?

GARLAND + FAUST HELLPOP DUO

Necro Folk Darlings, Spanish Cemetary signed a record deal from hell, literally!

Their children, who are Garland and Faust, now have to produce a world wide number one single within 666 days to liberate their parents from Hell!

Failure in this quest will see Garland and Faust also join their parents in Hell for all eternity, condemned to play infernal strip mall concerts as a supporting act for their parent's band Spanish Cemetary!

As you can imagine Garland and Faust don't want that outcome, but all the forces of Hell kinda do, and are out to stop them from their quest for a world-wide hit!

Ghosts with broken halos, largish snakes that can talk in broken English and a skeleton with a sailor's bowie knife are just some of the diabolic nasties on their tail!
