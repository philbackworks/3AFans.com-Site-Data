Hot-Foot was a 3A Halloween Figure release in 2013, continuing the 3A tradition of releasing a special figure on Halloween night. As the story goes, Hot-Foot was kicked out of the 10-finger gang because the "11 finger gang" just didn't have the same ring to it. Well that, and his penchant for setting things on fire! Hot-Foot was the bot responsible for charring <a href="/toys-1-6/hot-foot.html">Charkin</a>, the burnt-pumpkin-headed character that was the star of a previous Halloween night release. Hot-Foot wears a cloth coverall suit with hoodie, has removable pouches, comes with a flame-thrower and a removable fuel-tank backpack.
