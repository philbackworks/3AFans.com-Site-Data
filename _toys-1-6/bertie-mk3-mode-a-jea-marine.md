Release announcement from ThreeA from 2010 - 

"Rothchild Mechanics gives you the hard stiffy! MK3, the final Bertie! Bigger, stronger, and smarter than the previous Bertie, MK3 really brings a sharp advantage to the Earth forces who have exclusive rights to use MK3 in the battlefield. Mode B with its un-matched ballistics can bring the hurt to any situation, easily equaling the mighty Large Martin in the slap department! Mode A with its brutal door-to-door combat skills make close combat a bitch! The question is, what will Rothchild give the Martians to counter the might of the MK3? What are you up to? You dirty bastard Rothchild!

Enlarge your army at Bambaland this Friday, 26th November (2010) at 9-00am Hong Kong time!
