From <a href="https://www.goodsmile.info/en/product/4120/Real+Steel+Noisy+Boy.html" target="_blank">Goodsmile.com</a>:

"From the movie 'Real Steel' comes a figure of Noisy Boy featuring over 500 LED lights all over the figure. The LED lights on both arms can display one of five random messages. The shiny, metallic paintwork on the outside and weathered paintwork on the inside provides an amazing contrast which fans are sure to fall in love with."
