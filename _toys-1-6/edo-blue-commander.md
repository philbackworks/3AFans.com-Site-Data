"They are aware, aware of their job, think of them as a prototype TK, each color does indeed indicate a different skill. Prototypes from the past, for the future" - Ashley Wood, <a href="https://www.worldofthreea.com/threea-production-blog/qa39" target="_blank">Q and A #39</a> 

"...the story does in fact have a period where the TK are very few, hence the EDO TK, they replace the TK while [they are] M.I.A." - Ashley Wood, <a href="https://www.worldofthreea.com/threea-production-blog/qa13" target="_blank">Q and A #13</a>
