backstory: Surprise Drop. LTD Pre-Made. From the shipper box - "WO7174-BUNNY". This figure is based on Ashley Wood's partner, T. P. Louise, to commemorate 10 years of their studio, 7174.  Apparently T. P. wanted to release a commemorative t-shirt, but Ash said, "No, no leave it to me!" and came back with this special toy release, complete with her favorite white shoes!
