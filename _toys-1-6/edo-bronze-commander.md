"They are aware, aware of their job, think of them as a prototype TK, each color does indeed indicate a different skill. Prototypes from the past, for the future" - Ashley Wood, <a href="https://www.worldofthreea.com/threea-production-blog/qa39" target="_blank">Q and A #39</a> 

"...the story does in fact have a period where the TK are very few, hence the EDO TK, they replace the TK while [they are] M.I.A." - Ashley Wood, <a href="https://www.worldofthreea.com/threea-production-blog/qa13" target="_blank">Q and A #13</a> 

"They act like guards, not much talk but always watching and considering the situation, they dont chat, but can issue commands or statements that aid in the safety of its wards. They are machines, smart, but still machines that are programmed to protect at all costs! Like any machine, a situation far enough out of its sphere will be trouble! The period of no TK's is the EDO period in my Popbot universe, its a dark time, almost medieval in tone, it doesn't last long, but it's a shit time and the EDO are like the knights of the universal realm, something to look to for protection!" - Ashley Wood, <a href="http://worldof3alegion.forumotion.com/t287-qa-sessions-with-ashley-wood" target="_blank">Q and A #18</a>
