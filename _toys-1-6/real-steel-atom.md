From <a href="https://www.goodsmile.info/en/product/3883/REAL+STEEL+ATOM.html" target="_blank">Goodsmile.com</a>:

"From the film 'Real Steel' comes a figure of Atom, the robot that was put together by the main character's father, using nothing but salvaged parts from the junkyard. You can display Atom in the valiant fighting pose he took in his fight against the Champion, Zeus - recreating the excitement of the film's climax scene! His joints are all filled with cylinders and wires for a truly realistic appearance, and his eyes are loaded with fiber optic lights."
