"T.O.T.E.M consists of a select few that are the Earth's first line of defense. They are a covert group whose mission is to investigate and eradicate the interstellar horrors that plague the universe. 

The THUG are their weapon of choice, a remote operated bots capable of taking the enemy head on. Pugillo likes it rough. Savors every crunch under foot and a nice slow squeeeeeze until snap."
