From the official ThreeA promotional materials: 

"Eternity was in our lips and Francis."

"An underground army of the ultimate non conformists, no regard for right or wrong, or what the current thinking believes prudent! The Nabler Guy strike out on their own verve. A path best left alone unless you intend to join their family!

Features an dark grey/black body, weathered dark grey/black jumpsuit and sneakers to match, plus a baseball bat... and a 1/6 d*ck.
