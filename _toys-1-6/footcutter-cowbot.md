<p class="blockquote">Q: Do the 13 shit-heels the Blind Cowboy is hunting have anything to do with the illuminati or the occult? When can we expect them to make an appearance this year?
A: I want to make all 13, maybe do a shit heel club thing, buy them all, get a free ghost horse etc ? what ya think ?
