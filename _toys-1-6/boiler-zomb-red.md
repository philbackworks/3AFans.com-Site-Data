June 27, 2009 - From toysrevil.blogspot.com - "FYI - The <a href="/toys-1-6/zombot.html">ZOMBOT</a> is a 'lottery chase' - whereby anybody who had bought a regular Boiler Zomb will be eligible for. Ashley Wood says - 'if you get a zombot via lottery it's a choice to purchase on top of standard, or swap etc ... if you get via blind box, you can indeed get the zombie that was originally wanted or you email 3A and say no way to chase or rares in advance.'

A total of 5 Zomb Bots will be offered via lottery, while the rest (unspecified quantity) will be randomly inserted into boxes of standard Zombs.

Info via the hardwork of Gimbat on the 3A Forum"

Research indicates that the Boiler Zomb hairstyle is typically a shorter cut that slides over to the right.
