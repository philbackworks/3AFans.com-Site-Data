backstory:  LTD time sale. Comes with a new zomb head sculpt with neck adapter
---
"Red Atonement JC" or "Red Night JC" features the "New Pissed Off Head Sculpt", has fabric bandages, fake leather boots and comes with a "newly sculpted zombie head". This figure was available via a 'timed sale premade edition'.

"One thousand heads I shall deliver on this night, the RED NIGHT!"

"Red JC is really SUPER PISSED OFF JC, when he goes beyond his sedate, knee-the-evil-state-of-mind, he basically turns red and beats the living crap outta anything that moves!"
