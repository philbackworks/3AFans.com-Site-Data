<cite>Underverse Explorer Newsletter #3, May 2020</cite>

"The Geisha met Miles, a foreign army officer at a banquet and they fell in love soon after. They got married and returned to Mile's homeland together. His father was particularly vocal in his opposition to their marriage. He was cynical of her and hoped to drive her out of the family home. Not long after, Michiko mysteriously disappeared after Miles left on a business trip. Mile’s father claims that she ran off with another man and urged his son to found another wife.Miles however started to search for his wife, Michiko, but no one knows where she went."

Actress Natalie joined the circus, and Joker realized it's time for him to change his "professional track". Obviously, after getting his eternal smile, Joker can go nuts in new comedy shows."
