"I am the end of the world"

"Yes Father! I understand, brutal, sadistic, blunt weapon trauma..."

*FATHER*

"Evil strolls like a rooster among us

[Within the Adventure Kathedral] - Father â€” Old, weak, restore me!!

He loses himself.

It's time to...

RESURRECT!

A trumpet sounds. Somewhere a rooster pauses. And he walked among us... again!"
