backstory: A collaboration between UV + WWR x Dreaman. LED light-up eyes (*Requires 2x AG1 Batteries. Batteries not Included.) Originally planned for a presale on 1/8/2021 @ 10am HK, but was postponed to a later date. Black version is the 'standard edition', red is the 'limited edition'. Dreaman is an independent creative artist, designer, and engineer from Hong Kong (China) who has a strong interest in contemporary toy design and stylish character design. In recent years, he has been cooperating with overseas comics artists to generate a variety of collectibles (1/6 figures, 1/12 figures, robots, vinyl toys, etc). His skilled works include figures from MARVEL, DC, the Transformers franchise and other popular brands. His accumulation of experience and familiarity of pop-culture and sci-fi have made numerous collectables and trendy toy products into reality. With Underverse, Ashley Wood encourages its team members to pursue their creative side and has provided a platform for them to make their visions a reality. Thatâ€™s where UV+ WWR x DREAMAN SQMAN 06 is born.
