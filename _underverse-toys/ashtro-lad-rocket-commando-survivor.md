"Left like a relic, forgotten and covered in history. Warm to the touch, somewhere in the husk a heart beats, caressing memories of battles won and lost. No one calls his name, no one stops to ask, no one finds time. They defended the basement of the Underverse. The most powerful of all known Ashtro Lads. While you sleep, they keep you safe and sound. Writings from the Lad Tablet found on the Under Moon."
