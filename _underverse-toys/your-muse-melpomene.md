backstory: Pre-order open for 24-hours for estimated September 2020 shipping. Due to the production process each final figure will have unique variations in their texture patterns. In Greek, "Melpomene" means "to sing" or "one that is melodious" - Initially The Muse of Chorus, then she became The Muse of Tragedy. She is often represented with a tragic mask and wearing the cothurnus, boots traditionally worn by tragic actors. - wikipedia.com
