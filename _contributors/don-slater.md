Don Slater, from the 3A Legion group on Facebook, maintained a couple amazing spreadsheets that tracked 3A toy releases for 2012-2013. The files are available in the Legion's Facebook group. His spreadsheet data was instrumental in the initial planning of this website and helped inspire the vision of what this site could become. Thank you Don!
