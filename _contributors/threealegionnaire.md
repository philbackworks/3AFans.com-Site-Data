Threealegionnaire (Jason) is creative toy photographer and huge fan of 3A. His style is often characterized by artistic photo filtering and illustration-like image effects. He showcases a great collection of Pascha figures, Tomorrow Queens plus lots more. He captures their essence and emotion in unique ways. A true legionnaire, through-and-through. Happy to have him as a contributor to this site.
