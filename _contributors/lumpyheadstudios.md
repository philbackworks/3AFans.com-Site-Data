<i>Excerpt from his IG profile:</i> ARTIST - Simple Twist Up Dave Style....

A funny name but his work is anything but that! Lumpyhead tends to mix it up a bit, shooting all sorts of collectible toys and other "BADASS SHIT!" as he puts it, for Instagram. His style ranges from loud, neon color pops to gritty bots and close-ups. He has a good eye for texture and is a fan of that glow-in-the-dark-style. Glad to have his work featured here on 3AFans!
