Michael has a cool toy site called "Captain Toy" [<a href="http://mwctoys.com" target="_blank">mwctoys.com</a>]  - where he offers in-depth toy reviews, and in his words, "...the #1 source for collectible, toy, and action figure reviews!". You will find some great toy reviews for some older ThreeA toy releases. He graciously allowed me to include his detailed review photos on this site. Thank you Michael!
