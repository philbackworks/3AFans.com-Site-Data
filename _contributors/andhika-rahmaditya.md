Andhika (or dk_kuro on Instagram) is a toy photographer with a great eye for pose and style. He easily switches from dark, moody looks like those found in the deep, dramatic shadows he uses for N.O.M, to more soft, diffuse photos featuring the geisha-style TQ Desukisu or Pascha. His images capture well thought-out composition and mood -- perfect for 3A.
