Mike Y, a talented illustrator in his own right, has a nice collection of ThreeA photos to share with us. Under the alias, orange.riot, Mike has taken many cool photos featuring Tomorrow Queens, TK, Pascha and friends. His images range from clean, informative shots of figures on white backgrounds to sequential photos that often tell humorous stories in an almost-stop-motion style. Check it out!
