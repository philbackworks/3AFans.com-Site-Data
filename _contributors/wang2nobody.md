Toy collector. ThreeA aficionado.

Wang2Nobody shares great photos of his 3A toys on Instagram. He'll feature his figures with deep shadows (N.O.M, TK) or against brighter, clear backgrounds. His shot of the N.O.M Commanders outside in the snow is cool and he's shared some awesome photos from the ThreeA Beijing BTS Afterparty. Looking forward to what he shares next.
