Alex runs the blog, <a href="https://wwrmuseum.blogspot.com" target="_blank">World War Robot Museum</a>. From his first post:

"... an ongoing blog that will explore Ashley Wood's World War Robot (WWR) universe. There is no central wiki or book for the story of WWR and it is spread out across multiple art books, toy boxes, and sentences on the internet. I'm here to help address this problem by collecting that info and putting it into a single place."
