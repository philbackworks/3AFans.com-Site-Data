Love it or hate it, ebay is a great resource for 3A toys after you kick yourself for missing one of the official limited sales. You pay more, but most of us would agree, sometimes it's just worth it. Theartof_flipping is an ebay seller who typically has a nice selection of 3A toys, and takes very informative photos of figures, packaging and even the shipper boxes for some figures. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/usr/theartof_flipping" target="_blank">Check out his store!</a>
