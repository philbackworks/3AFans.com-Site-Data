Hey! I'm based in Indiana and I've always loved toys. I discovered 3A at San Diego Comic Con many years ago and I started off my collecting with a <a href="/toys-1-12/daywatch-heavy-bramble-idw/">Daywatch Bramble</a> (WWRp), then the Dead Astronaut Gangsta (1:6) figure really pushed me over the edge. I haven't looked back since. 

Having worked as a web and graphic designer for many years, I decided I would take on this project to help fans like me learn more about 3A and the many nuances of the 3A Legion. It also gives me an opportunity to sharpen my web skills and learn new things. I'm a fan and collector with a career and family, so this site will slowly grow over time. I hope to get other like-minded folks involved as we go along.


I post <a href="https://www.instagram.com/philback" target="_blank">my personal art and sketches on instagram</a>. I also occasionally pin <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/philback/art-of-ashley-wood-and-3a/" target="_blank">3A stuff on Pinterest</a>.
