Possibly the biggest Three A fan? Jordan (nyhousekid) collected pretty much everything 3A released up to 2015. So much that they named the <a href="/toys-1-6/mighty-square-emgy.html" target="_blank">Mighty Square EMGY</a> after him - with his name emblazoned across the front! How many fans can claim that level of designer toy stardom? Very happy to have Jordan as a resource as we tell the story of 3A on this site.
