MW Wutasi could be called the "Grandmaster of 3A Data", but that title <i>isn't quite good enough.</i> He is the keeper of an amazing spreadsheet that tracks 10 years of 3A releases, and still going. He has graciously allowed his data to be included on this website. 1100+ rows of detailed toy release information. Thank you for sharing this with 3Afans.com and the 3A collecting community!
