Missbincaboo, an "amateur toy photographer" from Vienna, Austria has a great eye for capturing the soft, peaceful side of Isobelle Pascha and friends. She uses great depth of field to put clear focus on her figures. Her photos featuring Lizbeth for example, are fun and cute and leave you wanting more. She adds little touches here and there to support her narrative and help tell a story. Things like pink furry textures, little props and critters (non-3A) make for some really fresh photos, and add an element of playful realism. Can't wait to see what her next 3A photoset will feature.
