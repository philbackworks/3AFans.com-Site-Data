toy_spot (Mike) features many toys in his photos and you can be sure of one thing: they are all great quality and well composed. Many of his 3A photos are taken outdoors so there's this really cool element of realism that continues to draw you in. He tends to favor forest and woodland-style settings for many of his 3A toy photos - at least at the time of this writing. He mixes in elements of gritty darkness, both in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BNVAOm4B4hD/" target="_blank">subject matter (Zomb on coke!?)</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BKWxJ92hMQl/" target="_blank">lighting (Rothchild & Caesar at sunset)</a>. He captures some great narrative moments in many of his shots, and includes thoughtful captions. So many great shots!
