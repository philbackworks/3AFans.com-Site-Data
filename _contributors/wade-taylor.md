Wade, otherwise known as "brickxbronson" from the old Flickr days, simply says "I take photos". He fails to mention that he takes really cool photos of various ThreeA toys in a variety of cool, outdoor settings with lots of natural light and sometimes atmospheric effects. He was an active member of the WWR Flickr groups back when that platform was in its heyday before the dawn of social media. Check his web link for all his toy pics and more.
