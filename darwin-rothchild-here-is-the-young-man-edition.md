backstory:
---
From the official ThreeA promotional materials:

"Here is the young man"

"It was obvious from a young age I was destined to be alone.
My ideas and outlook were always a step above my peers.
The death of my father was cartharctic, it was at my hands naturally.
But one set of hands could not do my much needed work alone.
So I simply made more, and set them around the world's throat"
