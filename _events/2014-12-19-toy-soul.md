There are a wild range of goods, toys and figures, including different scale of collectable figures, illustrations, digital games, side products and technological geeks. Apart from local exhibitors, there are a various amount of exhibitors coming from the globe, such as China, Macau, Tai Wan, Japan, Korea and Thailand etc. TOYSOUL is not simply a Hong Kong annual event, but also an iconic and influential goods exhibition in Asia./" - From the official website, toysoul.hk
