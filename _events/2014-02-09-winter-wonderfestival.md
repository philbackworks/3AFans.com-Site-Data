"Despite the heaviest snow Tokyo has seen almost half a century fans braved the harsh weather to attend WonderFest 2014. Taking place at the Makuhari Messe, the Tokyo Wonder Festival is a biannual mecca for toy, model, garage kit and pop culture enthusiasts alike. Few other conventions truly celebrate the great amount of artistry, skill, and care that are put into toys, model kits, and puppetry.

For several years 3A have wowed attendees at the show with their displays. 3A showcased over twenty figures from their range of Ashley Wood designed properties POPBOT, The World of Isobelle Pascha, World War Robot, Adventure Kartel, and a select few from their collaborations with creators like Kojima, Kenny Wong, and Dreamworks Studio's Real Steal. Internally referred to as the Cadillac of Toys, the Metal Gear Solid REX stood where it belongs - on the top shelf - with the incredibly massive RAY.

In collaboration with Goodsmile, 3A debuted an illustration sale for the first time outside of Bambaland with the the Undernaut Tomorrow King KOZO. The mysterious masked Origin Hunter TK said to have been named after a Naval General."
