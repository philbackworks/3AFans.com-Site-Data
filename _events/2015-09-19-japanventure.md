Join us on September 19th, as this year 3A presents the next VENTURE in Akihabara, Japan!

Ventures don't happen often, but when they do, they're not to be missed. Venture is a massive celebration of 3A's art, toys, and the worlds they build. First held in Hong Kong in 2009, and again in 2012 as REVENTURE, this year sees 3A and company travel to Japan. WITH SMILES ON OUR LIPS will be held at the incredible 3331 Arts Chiyoda. Ashley Wood, Phil Hale, William Wray, Amanda Visell, and Siuyin will grace the walls and showcases with their art, toys, statues, books, event exclusive figures, and more! Follow the With Smiles On Our Lips Show Blog for up to date info on the show. See you in Japan!
