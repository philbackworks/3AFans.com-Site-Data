# 3AFans.com-Site-Data
The markdown files used to generate the content on 3AFans.com.

This repository contains flat text files that are used to generate content on 3Afans.com - a fansite for ThreeA toys and artist Ashley Wood. The site is built using Jekyll and a Bootstrap website theme that I purchased. The content on the website will be the most current, but I will attempt to maintain them here as well. The goal of putting these files on github is to allow other fans to help create more content for the site using these files as templates.
