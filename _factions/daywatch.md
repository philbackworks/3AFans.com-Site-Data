description: The Daywatch colorway is very recognizable due to the clean white base color, and super high-contrast, minimal black markings. A white bat reversed out of a pitch black circle is the main emblem, along with the letters "DW". The gear bags and pouches are clean, bright white. Minimal weathering.
