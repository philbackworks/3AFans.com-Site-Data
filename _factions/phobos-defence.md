The phobos-defence colorway in World War Robot is characterized by heavily weathered rusty orange with red and black markings. The main pictogram appears to be the Mars symbol - a red circle ("shield") with red arrow ("spear") pointing top right. Also known as the sex symbol for "male". "Phobos Defence" is sometimes emblazoned across surfaces in a bold-n-blocky, sans-serif font. Pouches are dirty, dark gray. Phobos is the name of the second moon of Mars.
