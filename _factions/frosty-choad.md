description: The look of Frosty Choad is heavily weathered, like steel that has been exposed to extremely harsh elements. The base color is a dirty white, with layers upon layers of extreme rust. The graphics are comprised of light blue geometric shapes and blocky, sans-serif fonts. The gear bags and pouches appear a light rusty brown with lots of grunge.
