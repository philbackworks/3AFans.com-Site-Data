description: DIY stands for "Do It Yourself". These toys are produced in plain, unpainted white vinyl, plastic or resin. This platform allows an artist to create their own custom paint job on the figure. In November 2011, ThreeA hosted a toy show at the 1:AM gallery in San Francisco, CA, featuring custom figures of more than 30 amazing artists. Some fans will collect DIY figures and bring them to comic and toy events (i.e. San Diego Comic Con) to have Ash sign or do quick drawings on the figures.
