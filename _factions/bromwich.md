The Bromwich colorway in World War Robot is characterized by a dull pink, desaturated-red color base, with white decals and markings. "Bromwich" is sometimes emblazoned across surfaces in a bold-n-blocky, sans-serif font. Heavy weathering, dull red pouches and sometimes white angled stripes also mark this colorway.

On Bromwich and EVOL: "Bromwich stay pretty much the same in concept, part of the NUK in the WWR story, not a faction, but part of the greater NUK army (NUK stands for NEW UNITED KINGDOM)" - Ashley Wood, <a href="https://www.worldofthreea.com/threea-production-blog/qa40" target="_blank">Q and A #40</a>
