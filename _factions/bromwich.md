The Bromwich colorway in World War Robot is characterized by a dull pink, desaturated-red color base, with white decals and markings. "Bromwich" is sometimes emblazoned across surfaces in a bold-n-blocky, sans-serif font. Heavy weathering, dull red pouches and sometimes white angled stripes also mark this colorway. There was a Bromwich bramble referred to as <a href="/toys-1-12/bramble-pink-dazzle-rpg-wwrp.html">"Pink Dazzle"</a> in the <a href="/toys-1-12/large-martin-wave-three-3-pack-b.html">WWRp 3-Pack Set B</a> that included <a href="/toys-1-12/damn-large-martin-iron-panda-wwrp.html">Iron Panda (damn large martin)</a>, <a href="/toys-1-12/bramble-pink-dazzle-rpg-wwrp.html">Pink Dazzle (Bromwich bramble)</a>, <a href="/toys-1-12/large-martin-norge-defense-wwrp.html">Norge Defense (large martin)</a>.

On Bromwich and EVOL: "Bromwich stay pretty much the same in concept, part of the NUK in the WWR story, not a faction, but part of the greater NUK army (NUK stands for NEW UNITED KINGDOM)" - Ashley Wood, <a href="https://www.worldofthreea.com/threea-production-blog/qa40" target="_blank">Q and A #40</a>
