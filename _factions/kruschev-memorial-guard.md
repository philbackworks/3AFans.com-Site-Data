description: The Kruschev Memorial Guard colorway, aka "Red Under the Bed", can be identified by the gold hammer-n-sickle logo or the bold black letters, "CCCP" across a field of dirty red. Lots of dirty red and grungy yellow make up the bulk of this color scheme. Gear pouches are a middle brown tone.
