description: The Gravedigger colorway starts with a dark, gun metal grey base color. Front and center is the olde script font of the letter, "G". Next pile on lots of black weathering and some rust. Top it all off with a bone-white, violent looking cross... Like "X" marks the spot or is it a crucifix? You'll find the label, "Worm Food" on a Gravedigger, and other bright sayings like, "Counting bodies like sheep".
