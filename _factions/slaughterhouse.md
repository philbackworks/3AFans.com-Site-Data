description: The Slaughterhouse colorway is a grimy red, white and blue color scheme. The initials "SH6" can be spotted in a heavy, modern, block font on the main chest plate of bots. Red and blue accents adorn forearms, shoulders, and leges. Cloth elements have a really cool vertical, filthy blue-and-white stripe pattern. Oh, and meat cleavers, don't forget the meat cleavers.
