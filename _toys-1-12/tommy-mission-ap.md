It appears that the Tommy Mission figure in Wave 1 of the Action Portable (AP) release from ThreeA, has a red right hand. It also appears that one of the free promotional figures given away at New York Toy Fair, 2014 was Tommy Mission Red Right Hand. Still researching information on the Tommy photo featured here.
