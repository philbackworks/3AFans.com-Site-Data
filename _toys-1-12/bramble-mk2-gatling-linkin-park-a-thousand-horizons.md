From the ThreeA Legion Facebook group:
"It was for a charity event that Linkin Park was involved in. 10% of the sales went to earthquake relief. They were sold through Goodsmile I believe" - P. M. Kruger

From <a href="https://www.goodsmile.info/en/product/3274/WWRp+BRAMBLE+MK2+GATLING+Linkin+Park+EXCLUSIVE.html" target="_blank">Goodsmile:</a>
"A collaboration model between ThreeA and Linkin Park

A product announced at the charity event '<a href="http://1000horizons.com/" target="_blank">A Thousand Horizons</a>', which was held on the 9th September 2011.

Linkin Park, currently well known for the theme songs in the Transformers movie series, is working with ThreeA in an incredible collaboration to bring you a charity product - 10% of all proceeds will be donated to relief efforts in Japan."
