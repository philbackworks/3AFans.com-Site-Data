"His dead black eyes staring off into the distance like a shark tracking down its prey."

The desert themed Gebi de Plume soon followed as the first 3AA membership exclusive sale. In the prose piece "Intercepted Held N.O.M." Lieutenant Frank Pillitar describes in a letter running into the masked figure after a bloodbath of a battle in the desolate Gobi basin. "They got in my way" is all the lone figure said as he leapt off a wrecked bot and disappeared. Pillitar's superiors covered up any details of the masked merc. It's implied his letter was intercepted and the life of the Lieutenant was soon cut short." - TP Louise and Ashley Wood, 3A Adventure 001, April 2014 (page 36-37)
