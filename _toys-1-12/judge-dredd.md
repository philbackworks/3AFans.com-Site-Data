backstory:
---
"He is the law, complete with faux-leather tailored outfit with a weathered modern black leather look, sculpted iconic armor, and equipped with vintage Lawgiver MK1, the modern MK2, and the brutal Day stick. This 6", fully articulated figure of Dredd comes poised to dispense justice with extreme prejudice. Dredd includes interchangeable hands to grip weapons, open hands to wallop creeps, and clenched fists for perps to gaze into." - Source: ThreeA
