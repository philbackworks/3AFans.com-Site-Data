"MDL Harold is the sole surviving robot member of the Noachis Defence League which saw the Earth Defence Force drop 100 Large Martins from the Iron Panda division on the city of Noachis. The battle for Noachis was a turning point for MARS, where all ongoing negotiations were cancelled and the 'MARS ALONE' edict was passed - MARS annexed itself from Earth completely to forge an independent future. This of course was not seen favourably by the EDF! The war continues!" - <a href="https://www.goodsmile.info/en/product/4970/MDL+DEFENCE+HAROLD+MEMBER+ONE+SHITTY+9.html" target="_blank">Goodsmile.info</a>
