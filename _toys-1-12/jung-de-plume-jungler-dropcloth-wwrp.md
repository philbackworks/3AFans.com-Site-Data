"The last to use the original de Plume mold. His nomenclature, a coy nod to the jungle fatigues he wears and the analytical psychologist Carl Jung. 

Jung de Plume is described as more philosophical in his destructive fighting methods. Jung's presence and role in the ongoing story of World War Robot signaled a new change. With his final breath, he heralds the first of the Fallen." - TP Louise and Ashley Wood, 3A Adventure 001, April 2014 (page 36-37)
