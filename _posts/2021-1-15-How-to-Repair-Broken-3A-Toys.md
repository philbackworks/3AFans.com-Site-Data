3A Repair post!
I’d posted this up in the Unofficial ThreeA Buy/Sell/Trade group, but per Jordan Salas, this might have some value here.
I’d bought a slightly damaged 1/12 Dropcloth with a broken hip, and used Mr. Hobby Mr.CementS to repair it.
The main reason for the break is the poor design of the hip/pelvic assembly on these DCs. The peg that the ball (which goes into the leg’s hip socket) is on is barely connected to the central cylinder (the pelvis) of this figure. It only connects superficially with some glue, so in the event the ball-and-socket joint itself are frozen, any torsion applied to the joint is highly likely to rip the peg out of the “pelvis” by a shearing action.
Prep:
What I did to repair this was to get the ball and peg out of the hip with a standard hot water bath to soften the hip socket.
• I then trimmed off old glue with a pair of hobby nippers and a hobby knife, as well as sanded down the ball itself to prevent it from freezing the joint again once reassembled.
• I also trimmed out old glue from the pelvis itself.
Using a fair amount of Mr.CementS on the pelvic hole, I then moved the hip peg into place and gently held it steady for about a minute. Since the peg sits at an angle to the pelvis, and by design barely makes any contact with the pelvis itself, I had to make my best judgement of the angle and depth of contact.
After sitting to cure overnight, the pelvis was welded together! I don’t really have any painting skills, but what I do have is a 1/12 Dropcloth with a highly mobile, solidly-attached leg.
I’m also currently testing this process on 2 different 3A bot hand breaks: one at the ball on one end of a finger, and one where a finger joint itself shattered.
About the glue:
Mr. Hobby Mr.CementS is a solvent made for plastic models. I came across it while looking for ways to improve my modeling skills. It’s used to eliminate seams in plastic model kits, since it melts the plastics it comes into contact with. When you let two pieces of plastic sit with this cement between them, they bond as though they were always a single piece of plastic, which is quite strong! It’s also super toxic, so ventilate your workspace.

Update: The repair was on the right hip, but with the cold weather, the left hip is now completely stuck, and I heard a tiny “snap” as I attempted to move it.
IDK if it’s the vinyl the hip socket is made from, or the paint it’s slathered in that caused it to suddenly get stuck, but now it looks like I’ll be heating/popping the other leg, and sanding paint off of another joint.
