    <p>Over the last decade, 3A has commemorated benchmark achievements with the incredibly diverse Venture art showcases across the globe. With every Venture, fans are invited to a massive gathering of 3A’s art, toys, sculptures, and unique blend of DIY culture along with a selection of like-minded artists – all curated by Ashley Wood. 

    The first Venture originated at 3A’s Hong Kong Headquarters in 2009, filling the walls with art in every medium. The festivities continued to Beijing in 2010, and again in Hong Kong in 2012 for the aptly titled Re-Venture, with the most recent event held in Tokyo as the finale to a three-tour show. 

    The summer of 2017 brings with it the first ever Venture in the United States, and will bookend this era of 3A with US Venture Epilogue in San Diego to celebrate the culmination of all that has come before and to welcome the next exhilarating chapters to come! 

    Ashley Wood is thrilled to be joined by returning Venture artists Siuyin, William Wray, Seattle artist Syd Bee, as well as renowned comic book artists and designers Paul Pope and Geof Darrow!
