<h3>2008 - Year 1 - Pre-3AA</h3><a name="2008"></a>
<p>2008, the year it all started, or at least the beginning of 3A toys. The company was founded by Ashley Wood and Kim Fung Wong in Hong Kong. "Since the company is essentially ThreeZero x Ashley Wood, the name "ThreeA" is derived from the name of Kim Fung Wong's company, ThreeZero, and the first letter in Ashley Wood's name."* There doesn't appear to be much information related to this year online, as the official 3A site doesn't go back this far. I'll keep digging and hopefully hear from some of the first year veterans. </p>

<div class="blockquote">The 3AA (3A Associates) Membership did not exist in 2008. The first toy sale by ThreeA was June 24th (25th), 2008 with <a href="/toys-1-6/nom-de-plume.html">Nom de Plume</a>. Followed by Noir de Plume, Deep Powder and the 3+2 original Tomorrow Kings + Bot heads.

<div class="blockquote"><p><strong>How it all began for Kim and Ash:</strong></p>
<p><a href="/Kim-Fung-Wong/" target="_blank">Kim</a>: I collaborated with Brothersfree to produce Brothersrobber, and it was very popular and sold out quickly. One day, an American friend asked me whether I had leftover stock because an artist really liked it and would pay any price for it. I told him that I only had two sample figures left and they weren’t for sale. That friend asked me many times after that, so I told him that I would gift it to him as he was very sincere about it. As a result, even I don’t have the Brothersrobber figure! That artist is <a href="/Ashley-Wood/">Ashley Wood</a>. Subsequently, we decided to create toys together. The first release was Bertie MK1. My friend advised me to produce it as an 8” vinyl, as it would sell better. But Ash and I preferred to make something high-end. Ash said that the money was coming from me, not him anyway, so he insisted on a high-end toy that was priced at $300 USD each and an edition size of 500. A $300 USD toy was very expensive those days, and we were afraid that it wouldn’t sell. We asked a few American retailers/distributors but they were all unwilling to sell it because they felt that it was too expensive. Ash then said he has an online store called Bambaland that we can use. I actually had my doubts: Can an online store that sell cheaper t-shirts be suitable to sell such an expensive toy? Still, we decided to try. Unexpectedly, we sold 200 Berties on the first day, and it was sold out soon. That was how Ash and I started to team up. After that, we released Gebi de Plume and NOM de Plume.</p>

<h3>2010 - Year 3</h3><a name="2010"></a>
<p>I'm still digging up information on the 2010 membership, referred to as "new recruit day", January 15th, 2010. There were a limited number of membership spots available, according to the official site. New recruit memberships apparently "SOLD OUT" on the same day. It also appears that previous year members had a special window on January 8th, to renew. Membership was $150 USD and included the typical 15% discount, access to 3AA exclusives and the following:</p>

The purpose of the contest was to find ThreeA fans who genuinely wanted a DIY de Plume for customization purposes, and as a fun way to gift the figures out to those people.
