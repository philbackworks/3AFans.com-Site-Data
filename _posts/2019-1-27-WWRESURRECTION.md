<p>There's been a lot of activity over on the 3A Legion Facebook Group. One of the contributors to this site, Thong (<a href="/contributors/frutiger_/">frutiger_</a>) has issued a call to action for all 3A fans of World War Robot: use #WWResurrection on social media to communicate interest and support for the 3A WWR line of toys. This comes on the heels of the bad news that a particular robot figure would not be produced due to recent lack of sales and high production costs.</p>

<p>I'm hoping 2019 will be a great year for ThreeA. There will certainly be a lot more fans coming into the fold, as all toy releases will be available as public sales and no more membership perks. Hopefully this site will be a great resource for collectors at all levels.</p>
