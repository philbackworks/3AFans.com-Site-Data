<p>I will be at San Diego Comic-Con 2019 - roaming the floor everyday. I have a handful of free stickers I'll be giving to other 3A fans. Let's get together!</p>

<p>3AFans.com presents our first Unofficial ThreeA Toys Meet-Up and Drink-n-Draw at San Diego Comic-Con 2019. Any ThreeA fan who is in town for SDCC is invited to come hang out, talk toys, bring a sketchbook, or whatever you want. Nothing too formal, as a matter of fact, keep your expectations really low, and you're sure to have a great time! Anyone who wears some 3A (shirt, hoodie, hat, bag, mask, etc) OR brings a ThreeA toy will get some cool free 3AFans.com stickers while supplies last. More details as we get closer to Comic-Con.</p>

<p>Update: I also plan to have a little pile of FREE 3A-themed sketches I've been creating, as gifts for fellow fans.</p>
