<h3>The Last Big WWR Rollout</h3>
<img src="/assets/img/blog-mighty-squares-by-three-a-from-2014.jpg" alt="Mighty Squares by ThreeA, released 2014" class="img-fluid mb-2 mt-2">
<p class="lead mb-5 text-lg">This was the last sale where we got almost a full selection of the classic colorways (RIP IP Mighty, wherever you are).</p>

<p class="lead mb-5 text-lg">This was also a nice mix of old and new. In many ways it was the best of both worlds because <a href="/posts/ashley-wood/">AW</a> got to flex his creativity and give us a lot of new and fresh colorways like <a href="/toys-1-6/mighty-square-fat-cloud.html">Cloud</a>, <a href="/toys-1-6/mighty-square-meow-cd.html">Meow</a>, and <a href="/toys-1-6/mighty-square-p18-maid.html">Maid</a> BUT we also got returning classics like <a href="/toys-1-6/mighty-square-lunar-defence.html">Lunar</a>, <a href="/toys-1-6/mighty-square-wf-dbg-jungler.html">Jungler</a> and <a href="/toys-1-6/mighty-square-dutch-merc.html">Merc</a> to name a few.</p>

<p class="lead mb-5 text-lg">The fact that there was ‚Äúsomething for everyone‚Äù made this a really great sale versus the approach to WWR that came after this drop. After this drop sales became more about one-offs, new colorways, and less about classics that fans actually wanted. Still this drop did have some drama once it finally shipped because the final product varied greatly on some of the colorways. Graphics were changed on some Mighty for the best and others well... it was up for debate.</p>

<p class="lead mb-5 text-lg">‚ÄúSunken gate‚Äù was also a new QC struggle as some Square had sunken tops or bottoms. Though I originally thought <a href="/world-war-robot-harold/">Harold</a> was the last big WWR drop the Mightys make much more sense when you look back. This is when you could see WWR start to mutate and it‚Äôs a safe bet AW started feeling restrained by ‚Äúexisting colorways‚Äù. This is the start of the almost ‚ÄúKid Robot‚Äù influence of Squares becoming more of an <a href="/toys-1-6/diy-track-square-feat-various-artists.html">‚Äúart‚Äù vehicle</a> versus what many people wanted... y'know? actual <a href="/world-war-robot-story/#colorways">existing WWR factions.</a></p>

<p class="lead mb-5 text-lg">It‚Äôs also the start of many new colorways that didn‚Äôt really go with anything. I also don‚Äôt know of many new designs being in great demand minus cloud and Meow, maybe? Still, we would get more of these new colorways in <a href="/view-all-3ago/">3AGO</a> and a standard square pack. The preference of making random new colorways continued years later into the <a href="/toys-1-6/diy-track-square.html">track squares</a> and the more recent <a href="/view-all-3ago/">3AGO</a> styles like <a href="/toys-3ago/wwr-bomb-v2-square-2019-assortment-3pack.html">Bomb</a>, <a href="/toys-3ago/square-brains-on-show-clear-r1-red.html">Brain</a> and <a href="/toys-3ago/wwr-v-tol-square-r1-3pack.html">VTOL</a>.</p>

<p class="lead mb-5 text-lg">Sadly, this drop was the last time we would ever see many classic colorways in WWR form. RIP OG colorways!</p>

<h3>Another BIG WWR Release</h3>

<img src="/assets/img/blog-harold-by-3a-released-2013.jpg" alt="Harold by ThreeA, released 2013" class="img-fluid mb-2 mt-2">

<p class="lead mb-5 text-lg">The drop had 15 COLORWAYS!! <strong>15!!</strong> Look at all those friggin' colorways!!</p>

<p class="lead mb-5 text-lg">I'm pretty sure <a href="/world-war-robot-harold/">Harold</a> has the honor of being the 2nd "controversial" WWR release. Second only to the great <a href="/toys-1-6/dropcloth-1-5u-emgy.html">EMGY DC 1.5 shield</a> debate! Some people were frustrated that the 1/6th wasn‚Äôt as big as he ‚Äúshould‚Äù be. Others debated the design and some didn‚Äôt like being forced to buy two if they only wanted one. For $300 - SHIPPED - YOU GOT 2 BOTS! 1/6 AND 1/12th!! (Let that sink in. TWO SCALES for $300!!) AND if you [were a member of] 3AA, IT WAS EVEN CHEAPER!! Many people sold the scale they didn‚Äôt want and got an even better deal!!ü§Ø</p>

<p class="lead mb-5 text-lg">Harold remains very divisive to this day. I know more people that hate them vs love them. Personally, I feel he is highly under-appreciated, hell, I hated it orginally (and love it now! üòÖ). Once I got my first Harold in hand, I realized it's just a great, fun, bot.</p>
