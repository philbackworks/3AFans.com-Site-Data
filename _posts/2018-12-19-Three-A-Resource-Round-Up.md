<p class="lead mb-5 text-lg">Part of the fun of building this website is scouring the web for great content and inspiration. There are many great toy photographers out there taking killer shots of 3A toys. There are also some great toy reviews on YouTube, not to mention great discussion happening across social media. It's a great time to be a fan. </p>

<p class="lead mb-5 text-lg">As I go along, if I find collectors who are taking great photos that fit the aesthetic of this site, I reach out and ask permission to use their photos. Most have been very friendly and interested in supporting this project — which I really appreciate. I list credits and link to sources anywhere I can. I also list out <a href="/contributors/">contributors on the site here.</a></p>

<p class="lead mb-5 text-lg">Below, I've listed some of the resources I've been using for inspiration and guidance. Some of these sites have been around awhile without updates, but can still be great places to get a flavor of 3A's past. I'd like to revitalize some of this content in new ways, like this <a href="/ThreeA-Legion-History/">post on the history of the 3AA membership.</a></p>
