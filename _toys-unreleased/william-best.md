Worlds Best Robots

This character was mentioned in a previous blog post by ThreeA:

"Q: Just pre-ordered MARS - you mentioned William Best and Squidicorn next in the lineup.  Those (tentatively) slated for 2014 pre-orders? Can't wait to see Squidicorn!

A: <a href="https://www.worldofthreea.com/threea-production-blog/qa38" target="_blank">Best</a> soon, Squidicorn later, big toy!" - Ashley Wood, <a href="https://www.worldofthreea.com/threea-production-blog/qa39" target="_blank">Q and A #39</a>
