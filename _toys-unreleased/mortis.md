This character is not a toy... yet! 

"... I didnt want release them until we got some skinning tech down, we are close!" - Ashley Wood, <a href="https://www.worldofthreea.com/threea-production-blog/qa13" target="_blank">Q and A #13</a> 

A Popbot character possibly in the works, here are comments from a previous installment of the ThreeA blog:

"Q: Mortis figures were mentioned as a possibility this year, but I assume that with so much on 3a's plate, that they may be pushed into 2015. Did the re-tooling of <a href="/toys-1-6/lastronaut.html">Lass'</a> skin complicate the prototyping of the Mortis? In essence, how much closer are we to seeing some Supermenses?

A: Just manpower and time, we have little of each. The <a href="/toys-1-6/lastronaut.html">Lass</a> tooling didn’t hold anything up except the Lass, the Mortis is different, as mentioned Lass is only half skinned, legs and groin, the Mortis will have to be full skinned, which now we know we can do. I can’t stress enough how small the team is making all of the toys, hopefully gods willing we shall make all the toys we dream of!" - Ashley Wood, <a href="https://www.worldofthreea.com/threea-production-blog/qa39" target="_blank">Q and A #39</a>
