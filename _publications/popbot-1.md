summary: Ashley Wood proves again the Dada's weren't that abstract in their approach to a story! Take a cat, a robot, and Andy Warhol; mix in haunted houses, sexy girls, and an undersea conversation pod. What do you have? The first issue of PopBot! Written and drawn by Ashley Wood, the popular artist of X-Men, Hellspawn, and WildStorm's upcoming Automatic Kafka. PopBot is printed in a large format and has 48 beautiful pages! PopBot also features guest artists and writers. - From Amazon
