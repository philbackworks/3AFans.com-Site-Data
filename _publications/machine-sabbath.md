<p>"...Machine Sabbath is that world we all live in, some can see it, some admit it, most hide in the open dreaming of living in it. A rejection of the world that accepts violence and death yet cries in disgust at the carnal, a world run by the memories and edicts of the dead and dreadful.</p>

<p>Whispered but heard by all" - Ashley Wood, March 2013 (Machine Sabbath intro text)</p>
