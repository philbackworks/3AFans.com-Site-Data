  review1: This is a massive book at 800 pages and 2.25" thick! It is heavy and awesome. Yes it reprints artwork found in previous art books by Ashley Wood, but it's great to have them all contained in one gigantic tome. As you can imaging, it features pretty much everything! For the newer Ashley Wood fan, it's great to see lots of Ash's earlier works and catch references and ideas that later became toys or elements in his modern storytelling. This is a fun book to have in the collection. - Phil
