summary: It’s total robot war! In development to be a major motion picture [still true?], Ashley Wood’s World War Robot tells the tale of a dwindling band of humans and robots who face off in a battle that will likely end humanity as we know it — on Earth, on the Moon, and on Mars, too! Badass battles, really intense human/robot drama, and even a little black humor and political intrigue are the order of the day in this oversize epic that collects both previous books in one deluxe hardcover volume.  - From Amazon
