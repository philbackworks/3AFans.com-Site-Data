summary: It's total robot war! In development to be a major motion picture, Ashley Wood's World War Robot tells the tale of a dwindling band of humans and robots who face-off in a battle that will likely end humanity as we know it — on Earth, on the Moon, and on Mars! Badass battles, really intense human/robot drama, and even a little black humor and political intrigue are the order of the day. - From Amazon
