From BBTS: 
"The dark mirror of Optimus Prime, a twisted clone of the Autobot leader imbued with all his strength, abilities, and intellect, but lacking all moral restraint and compassion. Nemesis Prime serves only the World Eater Unicron and carries within him the Dead Matrix, possibly the only thing in the universe that can destroy the ancient Primus. Nemesis Prime’s brutality is known and feared by Autobot and Decepticon alike!"

Made of plastic and 30% die-cast detailing.

LED Illumination: Optics, Decepticon Badge, Blaster Rifle, Matrix Chamber

Additional features include removeable tankard grenades and magnetically removable tire wells.
