King Coal is a 16" black Ashtrolad with white eyes.

Ten years of searching, searching for a way to escape the Underverse, Ashtrolad has finally found a way out, the Deca Portal! All robots beware Ashtro has returned.

His search for his robotic sister starts 2019, and what is Bambalad up to? Friend or foe?
