"Q: I am interested to know more about Wonka/Wanka Squares! How many variants are there in total and anything you can share about them?
A: 3 versions in the wild, plus prototype flavors. Actually you guys got the 3rd version, my youngest is in possession of all the previous versions. We might do more as one-offs and show exclusives etc. I love them, <a href="/contributors/brent-ashe/">Brent</a> did a great job on the wrapper, I like my Square designs, probably not everyones thing, but I rate them a high point in Square stuffâ€¦ I want a Mighty Wanka now!" - Ashley Wood, <a href="https://www.worldofthreea.com/threea-production-blog/qa39" target="_blank">Q and A #39</a>
