Earth Mother

From <a href="https://www.goodsmile.info/en/product/7478/FANG+GAL+R4+BURNT+SMILE+FANG.html" target="_blank">Goodsmile</a>:
"A strange blue relic was located just off the coast of La Jolla, California in July 2018. It was initially thought to be a fake due to its pristine appearance but carbon dating puts it in the realm of at least a trillony millony years old! Is it an alien fertility totem, or something more sinister? The blue one was just the start. In the same month, an almost identical relic was found in the mountains of Kyoto, but it instead had a fiery orange color. Plus it is rumored that one who licks the totem is granted great luck...

An Earth Mother is a goddess that symbolizes fertility, good harvest and vitality of the earth. Since prehistoric times statues of Venus have been idolized and worshipped, but as a part of threeA's 10th anniversary we have worked with Ashley Wood to create a new Earth Mother statue - FANG GAL! This Wonder Festival exclusive orange color version named BURNT SMILE FANG stands approximately 33cm in height and is an artistic toy designed for adult collectors. The neck and hips are articulated for different poses."
