backstory:  From Gregory Prout on the ThreeA Legion FB board - "From memory there are two in Germany, one in Latvia, one in the Netherlands, a couple in Spain, and yours. At least two in Singapore, and one in Japan. Three in NY, one in California, one in Washington, one in the DC area, and I want to say one in the south. The rest are in Hong Kong/Thailand/China." (2019) ... Then also from the fan comments - "One in New Jersey" (Aaron Romyns) and "One in Mexico" (Jorge Zamora.)
